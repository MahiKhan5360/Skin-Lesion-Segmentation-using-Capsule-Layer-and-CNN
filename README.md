# Capsule-Based CNN for Binary Image Segmentation (ISIC 2018)

This repository contains a custom deep learning architecture that integrates Capsule Networks into a CNN encoder-decoder framework for binary image segmentation (e.g., skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images like the ISIC 2018 dataset).

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The current model is **not memory-efficient** and may crash on systems with **<16 GB system RAM** and **<15 GB GPU memory** (e.g., T4 GPU with 15 GB).
